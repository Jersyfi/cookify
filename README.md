## Documentation

### Get started

To start with that project you can simple install Cookify with npm.

```bash
npm install cookify
```

After that you need to import the npm module correctly. How you need to import the npm correctly to your project depends on you. I will give an simple example for importing a npm module and how to initialize it in ordner to use the functions correctly.

```javascript
import Cookify from Cookify

var cookify = new Cookify
```

For customization you can inicialize Cookify with the following variables or functions described below. Every variable and function has a default value that you don't need to set it. But you need to watch on the described sheme in order to inicialize correctly.

```javascript
var cookify = new Cookify(
    dataName,
    actionCallback,
    trackingCallback,
    saveWithChange,
    saveByDefault,
    cookieDefault
)
```

dataName -> string (default: cookify) \
actionCallback -> function (default: () => {})\
trackingCallback -> function (default: () => {})\
saveWithChange -> boolean (default: false)\
saveByDefault -> boolean (default: false)\
cookieDefault -> string (default: necessary)

To explain the initialization better i will give a simple example with all variables and functions and how to use them. `dataName` is for the name that will show in the data storage for Cookify. The `actionCallback` is called after the user clicked on the following `data-c-action` fields. With that function you can close the cookie consent field as an example. Then you have the function `trackingCallback` for tracking user activity. This function needs a data variable where the data[0] stores all types and the viewed state and data[1] stores the actual date. `saveWithChange` can be set if you want to change the user selection when clicking on the input fields. The `saveByDefault` variable is for saving the selection when loading the first time. At least we have the `cookieDefault` variable where you can set the default cookie type name.

```javascript
var cookify = new Cookify('cookie_consent', function () {
    document.getElementById('element').style.display = none
  }, function (data) {
    console.log(data)
  }, false, false, 'necessary')
```

### Query Names

The query names are necessary for using Cookify. There are different checkboxes for controlling the cookie activity and you can handle the cookies with a few different actions. Below are all usable query names and how to use them properly.

You can only use the `data-c-check` on input fields. As an example for type checkbox.

**data-c-check="{string}"**

```html
<input data-c-check="necessary" type="checkbox">
```

You are able to set a preset value of the field. When you don't set this default value it is false.
  
**data-c-check-default="{boolean}"** (default: false)

```html
<input data-c-check="necessary" data-c-check-default="true" type="checkbox">
```

You have 3 ways to for saving. Use `accept` when you want the user to save the selected fields, `all` will select all fields and save them and `necessary` is for selecting only the necessary field.
  
**data-c-action="{string}"**
  - necessary (Save only the required cookies)
```html
<div data-c-action="necessary">Necessary</div>
```
  - all (Save the selected cookies)
```html
<div data-c-action="all">All</div>
```
  - accept (Save all cookies)
```html
<div data-c-action="necessary">Necessary</div>
```

That you are able to handle the scripts for the user selected types you need to set `data-c-script` where it is necessary. It is only possible to use the types that are used in the query names `data-c-check`. This will either work for scripts with import src or with inline scripts.

**data-c-script="{string}"**

```html
<script type="text/plain" src="example.js" data-c-script="necessary"></script>

<script type="text/plain" data-c-script="necessary">
  console.log(example)
</script>
```

### Helpers

When you want to know the exact state of a type or if the user viewed and agreed the consent already then use the `getDataState()` function. The output is a boolean value (true or false).

```javascript
cookify.getDataState('type')

cookify.getDataState(cookify.viewedName)
```
